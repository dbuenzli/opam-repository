description: """
WARNING this package is unstable and work in progress, do not depend on it. 

B0 describes software construction and deployments using modular and
customizable definitions written in OCaml.

B0 describes:

* Build environments.
* Software configuration, build and testing.
* Source and binary deployments.
* Software life-cycle procedures.

B0 also provides the B00 build library which provides abitrary build
abstraction with reliable and efficient incremental rebuilds. The B00
library can be – and has been – used on its own to devise domain
specific build systems.

B0 is distributed under the ISC license. It depends on [cmdliner][cmdliner].
